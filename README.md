# React Interview Scheduler

> Interview Scheduler was my first ever [React](https://reactjs.org/) application. During it's development my goal was to learn about the fundamentals of React while also gaining real-world experience building full-stack applications.

If you don't know what React is already, it is a Javascript Library which is made for front-end development and it focuses on the idea of component based integration/rendering. Don't worry if that doesn't make sense. Two weeks ago I had no idea what React was either.

The app uses React components to render a UI for adding, updating, and removing interviews to and from the database. The functionality could be extended to include a more robust calendar or allow users access to more features other than just booking interviews.
